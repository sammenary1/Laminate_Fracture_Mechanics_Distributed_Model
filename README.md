# Laminate_Fracture_Mechanics_Distributed_Model
This notebook contains the distributed model of my master's project thesis. This program is being developed to implement current model research on a finite fracture mechanics model for the prediction of the open-hole strength of composite laminates which can be found at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359835X12000978 as part of a final year MEng project with supervisor Dr Giuseppe Catalanotti.

The model provides a fast and accurate method for calculating the failure behaviours of open-holed compostite materials under tensile load. 

Accompanying thesis graded 75%.
